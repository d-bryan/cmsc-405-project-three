## Overview

In this project you will create a unique 3D animated scene 
composed of Three.js graphic components. The scene should 
include animation, lighting and multiple objects.

## Requirements

   has the following specifications:
   - Size: minimum of 640x480
   - Includes at least 6 different shapes
   - Uses multiple lighting effects
   - Includes radio buttons, slider bars or other widgets to

   (http://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html)
4. Prepare, conduct and document a test plan verifying your 
   application is working as expected. This plan should include 
   a test matrix listing each method you tested, how you tested 
   it, and the results of testing

## Deliverables

1. All JavaScript source code used for this project. Code 
   should adhere to the Google Javascript style guide.
2. Word or PDF file demonstrating with clearly labeled screen 
   captures and associated well-written descriptions, the 
   successful execution of your 3D Three.js animated scene. 
   The document should be well-written, well-organized, 
   includes the test plan, include page numbers, captions for 
   all screen captures, and a title page including your name, 
   class, section number and date. References should be included
